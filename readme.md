I have over two million rows in the Users table. When I try to find a specific user by email it takes a long time to get the results. How can I improve that?

Please make sure that no duplicate email addresses are allowed



# Dotnet

## Copilot

// Create a class called User with properties for Id, Name, Email and LastLogin

## Cmd+I
Make sure that Email is a proper email address

Make sure that Name is required and not longer than 20 chars

I want to setup EF Core for the User class and the Users table. What do I need to do and can you give me the code needed to use it in my controllers?

I already have a SQL Server table called Users that I want to use for this entity. How ever, in my table the LastLogin field is called last_login. How can I use the existing table and make sure the property and db column match even though the name is not exactly right?

# React

## Cmd+I in ListReviews.tsx
create a component that uses a useEffect to fetch data from https://example.com/reviews and stores the JSON response in a state variable. The response is an array of object that contains proerties with name and score. Render a component that lists all reviews with a header for the name and a number for the score. 

## Chat
I've heard people say online that fetching data inside a useEffect is a bad practice and that libraries like React Query should be used. Please explain why and show me how I can use React Query instead.
